## MemoryExpress Programmer's Test

We've put together a simple programmer's test for our hiring process here at 
MemoryExpress to get an assessment on your problem solving skills & subject 
knowledge. It is not required that you complete all the tests but the more 
you can complete the better. We will be looking at _coding style, the 
approach of your solution and any unique components of your solution_. 

The test is written in C#.NET (as it's our primary language/platform here) 
and you can open it using Visual Studio or [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) 
if you do not own a copy of visual studio.  

### Project Structure

The basic tests lie in the `Tests` Project. Each folder inside the project 
contains all the relevant classes / code required to complete the test. 
To begin inspect the `Test.cs` file under each test to see what the 
parameters of the test are. In these tests we're looking to asses basic 
problem solving skills & code reading skills. **Note: Please do not modify 
the unit tests.**
